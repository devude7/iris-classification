# iris-classification
An iris species classification project with a neural network built from scratch. The project contains several approaches, including:
- Binary classification built from scratch using a perceptron architecture
- Multiclass classification built from scratch using multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture
- Multiclass classification using PyTorch library 
- Multiclass classification using TensorFlow library  

## Results
All of the approaches achieved near-perfect accuracy, as the problem is quite simple. The main objective of the project was to develop an artificial neural network from scratch to better understand what's happening behind the scenes, so to speak. The library approaches are meant to showcase how easy it is to build such architectures without deep underlying knowledge.
